# CATS FRIENDS - A REACT WEB APP

Welcome to Cats Friends, a delightful web application for cat lovers! This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and allows you to explore a list of adorable cats with an intuitive search functionality. Additionally, the app dynamically fetches user data from an external API [{JSON} Placeholder](jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and displays user cards associated with the cats.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Start the app in development mode using npm start. It will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.
4. As you make changes to the code, the page will automatically reload, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

## Building for Production
